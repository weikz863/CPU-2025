# Register File

## Overview

The Register File stores the current values of architectural registers. Each register entry includes a value and a tag(with validness indicator) that indicates which ROB entry will produce the next value for that register. This implements register renaming to handle write-after-write (WAW) and write-after-read (WAR) hazards, enabling out-of-order execution. It has two reading ports for each functional unit.

## Ports

In the Chisel design, the Register File module has the following IO ports:

### Inputs

- `ROB_index` and `value`: value with validness indicator from CDB.
- `tail`: ROB tail position, combined with
- `destination`: of the issued instruction from IF, used to update tags.
- `clear`: boolean clear signal from ROB.

### Outputs

one set of the following for each functional unit, which means two sets, for ALU and LSB.

- `rs1_value`: Value read from register rs1.
- `rs1_tag`: Tag associated with rs1 (if not ready).
- `rs1_tag_valid`: Tag validness indicator.
- `rs2_value`
- `rs2_tag`
- `rs2_valid`

## Inner Workings

### Structure

The Register File consists of:

- **Register Array**: Array of register entries, each containing:
  - `value`: Current value.
  - `tag`: Tag of the station producing the next value (or invalid if ready).
  - `tag_valid`: Bit indicating if the tag is valid
- **Read Ports**: Combinational logic for reading rs1 and rs2.

### Operation

1. **Read Operations**: On read requests, returns the current value and tag.
2. **CDB Monitoring**: Continuously checks CDB broadcasts. If the tag matches a register's tag, updates the value, sets tag to invalid.
3. **Initialization**: On reset, all registers are set to zero, no tags. On clear, the tags all become invalid.

## Implementation Details

No penetration - read and monitor are separated. The corresponding functional unit is responsible for simultaneously reading from the register file and listening to CDB broadcasts.
