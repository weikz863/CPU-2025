# Instruction Fetch

## Ports

The Instruction Fetch module has the following IO ports:

### Inputs

- `reset`: reset program counter to value, from ROB, valid protocol

### Outputs

- decoded instruction (ready/valid protocol) to ROB/LSB/ALU
- `destination`: instruction destination to RF.

## Inner Workings

### Structure

The Instruction Fetch has an asynchronous memory as instruction memory, a program counter, a decoder and a FIFO buffer with a fixed depth (i.e. chisel Queue) of decoded instructions.

### Operation

On the reset signal, clear all contents of instruction queue and reset program counter to received value.
When the queue is not full, the decoder reads the next instruction and decodes it, putting it in the buffer.
When ROB and corresponding functional unit (ROB/LSB/not required) are ready, issue the next instruction in queue. Tell RF to update register tags.
The current branch prediction method is the most naive, assuming a jump always occurs.
